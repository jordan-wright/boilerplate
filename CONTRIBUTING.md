## Everyone is welcome to add a new free boilerplate to the list
Yep, that is true, you and your friends are welcome to add new free boilerplates to the list. And by free, we mean free, really free.
And you know what? It's really easy, see below.


## Steps to add a new boilerplate
 Make sure that you've read [Contribution](https://github.com/jordan-wright/boilerplate/wiki/Contributing), which guides you to editing a repository. Then:

1. Again, unlike other projects, we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change in a pull request - it's fine to have one pull request, but please make sure your title reflects what you've changed.
2. Use our standard for formatting the .md file. Check it out: [Formatting](#formatting)
3. Please try to use alphabetic order.


### Formatting
We are adults. Let's respect the next standard.
+ All lists are ```.md``` files. Try to learn Github's Markdown syntax. It's simple!
+ All the lists start with an Index, the idea is to show all of sections and subsections there, so it's important to have an index for each section. Right now it's alphabetized, so please use alphabetic order.
+ Sections are using level 3 heading (in HTML is ```<h3>```, in Markdown is ```###```), and subsections are using level 4 (in Markdown is ####).
+ Sections consist of a level 3 heading for the primary technology, and a list of repositories,
+ Repositories are listed with the repository name followed by a comma separated list of included features.
+ Boilerplates with identical names should be listed in the format username/repo-name.

The idea is to have
+ ```2``` empty lines between last suggested boilerplate & header 
+ ```0``` empty line between header & first boilerlate of that very section.
+ ```0``` empty line between each boilerplate in 1 section.
+ ```1``` empty line at the end of each ```.md``` file.

Like this example:
```
###Flask
* [flask-boilerplate](https://github.com/mjhea0/flask-boilerplate) - Bootstrap, Coverage, Fabric, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF

BAD : * [flask-boilerplate](https://github.com/mjhea0/flask-boilerplate)-Bootstrap, Coverage, Fabric, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF
GOOD: * [flask-boilerplate](https://github.com/mjhea0/flask-boilerplate) - Bootstrap, Coverage, Fabric, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF
```


And that's it! Simple, easy and lovely...

We hope you contribute to this great repository. :+1:
