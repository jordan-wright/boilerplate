#boilerplate
##Intro
This list contains free boilerplate templates to help you get started on a new project quickly. Modeled after the fantastic [free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books) repository, the goal of this list is to contain boilerplates for as many languages and project goals as possible.

This list is on GitHub to encourage pull-requests and contributions!


###How To Contribute
Create a boilerplate you think will benefit the community? Know about a boilerplate that you use often and think people should know about? Send us a pull request!

Contributing is easy and encouraged! To contribute, check out [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Read the [TODO](/TODO.md) file(Adding new boilerplates is our #1 priority, but things like Alphabetizing and adding/removing boilerplate features are important, too.)
- Edit (we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change)
- [Send a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

**Small commits are preferred, where possible, to help organize and maintain modifications.**
